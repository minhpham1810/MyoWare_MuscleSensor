To run files:

Download and install cmake

Within the "files" directory in terminal, do:
    mkdir build
    cd build 
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .

One way to run files after that is to go to the Debug folder within build and run the .exe of the file
--> from build directory, do:
        Debug\HandTrack.exe
